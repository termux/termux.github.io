This is a vulnerability report for `termux-app`, `termux-tasker` and `termux-widget`.

It is being released on `2022-02-15`, after `30` days of `termux-app` [`v0.118.0`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.118.0) release and `~150` days since Google Playstore builds were officially deprecated with a terminal banner added in [`termux-tools` `v0.135`](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/pull/7493) and [`termux-app` readme was updated with deprecation details](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/commit/94e01d68). This should have allowed enough time for users on Google Playstore builds (latest version `v0.101`) to move to F-Droid/Github releases for `Termux` app and all its plugin apps and enough time for other `Termux` app users on `<= v0.117` to update to `>= v0.118.0`.

**Users are advised to immediately update to [`Termux` `v0.118.0`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.118.0), [`Termux:Tasker` `v0.5`](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker/releases/tag/v0.5) and [`Termux:Widget` `v0.13.0`](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/releases/tag/v0.13.0) if they are using any older version.**

## 1. Termux:Tasker Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

This vulnerability allowed execution of **any command** in `termux` context or even `root` context if termux had been granted root permissions by **any app**.

The vulnerability existed since the first release of the plugin [`v0.1`](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker/releases/tag/v0.1) (`2016-12-26`) till `<= v0.4` and was fixed in [`v0.5`](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker/releases/tag/v0.5) (`2020-12-07`).

The vulnerability existed in [`FireReceiver`](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker/blob/v0.4/app/src/main/java/com/termux/tasker/FireReceiver.java#L50) of the `Termux:Tasker` app where it didn't check the full canonical path of the executable and executed it as is. The `Termux:Tasker` app is only meant to allow scripts in `~/.termux/tasker` directory to be executed to prevent arbitrary commands to be run in termux context by other apps but without the canonical path check for the executable, an app could send `../../../usr/bin/bash` as the executable value and `-c "some termux context command"` as args value to run commands in `termux` context or send `../../../usr/bin/su` as the executable value and `-c "some root context command"` as args value to run commands in `root` context.

Note that it does not require a plugin app to send intents to `FireReceiver`, but any app can send the intent using java. The [`Termux:Tasker Exploit`](/assets/posts/globals/general/2022-02-15-termux-apps-vulnerability-disclosures/Termux_Tasker_Exploit.tsk.xml) task does just that and uses `Tasker` java actions to emulate how a normal app would send an intent.

### 1. Proof Of Concept

```java
Intent intent = new Intent("com.twofortyfouram.locale.intent.action.FIRE_SETTING");
intent.setClassName("com.termux.tasker", "com.termux.tasker.FireReceiver");

Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
bundle.putString("com.termux.tasker.extra.EXECUTABLE", "../../../usr/bin/bash");
bundle.putString("com.termux.execute.arguments", "-c \"echo -n 'I am '; whoami; echo 'creating exploit-file'; touch exploit-file; echo 'finding exploit-file'; find . -name exploit-file 2>/dev/null; sleep 5;\"");
bundle.putBoolean("com.termux.tasker.extra.TERMINAL", true);
bundle.putInt("com.termux.tasker.extra.VERSION_CODE", 4);

intent.putExtra("com.twofortyfouram.locale.intent.extra.BUNDLE", bundle);
context.sendBroadcast(intent);
```

### 1. Fix

1. To send an intent to `FireReceiver` now [requires `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND`](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker/blob/v0.5/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L45), a `dangerous` runtime permission, to be granted to the calling app, which was [published by Termux app](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/v0.118.0/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L16). The Tasker app already had requested the permission since `v5.9.3` for [`RUN_COMMAND` intent](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/RUN_COMMAND-Intent) before the `v0.5` release but other automation apps would have had to request the permission in later versions. ([`26da42f7`](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker/commit/26da42f7))

2. The canonical path of the executable received by `FireReceiver` was [found](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker/blob/v0.5/app/src/main/java/com/termux/tasker/FireReceiver.java#L70) before it was processed. The `v0.5` release officially added support to allow executables outside the `~/.termux/tasker` directory, but only if user had explicitly added `allow-external-apps=true` to `~/.termux/termux.properties`. ([`a5af3db3`](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker/commit/a5af3db3))

This dual permission model enforced by android os permission and an app setting for absolute paths provides reasonable security against any arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation unless users grant the permission to untrusted apps.

Check `Termux:Tasker` [`README`](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker#setup-instructions) for more details on new design.

### 1. Discussion

This kind of vulnerability partly existed because **any app can send intents to plugin apps** of automation apps like `Tasker`. The `Tasker` app and the [`locale`](https://github.com/twofortyfouram/android-monorepo) plugin protocol library it uses were created around `2008`. At that time runtime permissions didn't exist and security and possible dangerous uses of plugins may not have been a top priority/concern. However, it is indeed especially concerning for plugin apps that are granted privileged permissions like device admin/owner and accessibility services or even storage, location, etc. For example the [`SecureTask`](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.balda.securetask) plugin needs to be set as device admin or even owner for a lot of its features. If a user has installed the app on their phone and have granted the device admin permission to `SecureTask`, any app could send intents to it directly without going through Tasker to run privileged commands, including **wiping the device**.

The `Termux:Tasker` requirement for `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND` permission requires Tasker and all other automation apps to request the permission in their `AndroidManifest.xml`, but this can't be expected to be done for almost every plugin that exists since it would require manual intervention of all automation app devs. Moreover, private plugins may exist to with their custom permissions, whose info their devs may not want to release to the public. Possibly some kind of token generation and validation mechanism needs to be designed, possibly as core part `locale` library. Hopefully, more thought can be given to this and termux, automation and `locale` lib devs can collaborate to implement something in (near) future, since current design is not how it should be.

## 2. Termux:Widget Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

This vulnerability allowed execution of **any command** in `termux` context or even `root` context if termux had been granted root permissions by any **launcher app** in which the user had created a launcher shortcut and by **any malicious app** which started the `Termux:Widget` shortcut chooser activity and user accidentally selected a shortcut regardless of if the app was the default launcher or not.

The vulnerability existed since the first release of the plugin [`v0.3`](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/releases/tag/v0.3) (`2015-12-20`) till `<= v0.12` and was fixed in [`v0.13.0`](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/releases/tag/v0.13.0) (`2021-09-23`).

The `Termux:Widget` "security" worked by [generating a token](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/blob/v0.12/app/src/main/java/com/termux/widget/TermuxLaunchShortcutActivity.java#L23) and storing it in shared preferences. Now every time a static shortcut was created for a launcher app, it was [sent this token](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/blob/v0.12/app/src/main/java/com/termux/widget/TermuxCreateShortcutActivity.java#L50) as an extra in the shortcut intent created. When the user triggered the shortcut, the shortcut intent was sent by the launcher app and received by `TermuxLaunchShortcutActivity` and it was checked if the [one in the intent matched against the one stored in shared preferences](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/blob/v0.12/app/src/main/java/com/termux/widget/TermuxLaunchShortcutActivity.java#L39). Now this provided decent security and is usually how APIs work, but [no canonical path validation was being done](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/blob/v0.12/app/src/main/java/com/termux/widget/TermuxLaunchShortcutActivity.java#L51) before passing it to [`TermuxService`](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/blob/v0.12/app/src/main/java/com/termux/widget/TermuxLaunchShortcutActivity.java#L51). It was not checked if the canonical path was under the `~/.shortcuts` directory. So basically once a malicious launcher or any app had received a token, it could run any command at any time by sending a custom path like `/sdcard/exploit.sh` for foreground commands or `/sdcard/tasks/exploit.sh` for background commands (`Termux:Widget` would assume it as background [since parent dirname would equal `tasks`](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/blob/v0.12/app/src/main/java/com/termux/widget/TermuxLaunchShortcutActivity.java#L55)).

### 2. Proof Of Concept

1. Install [`Termux:Widget` `v0.12`](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.widget).

2. Create a shortcut from termux terminal: `touch ~/.shortcuts/tasks/test`

3. Get the token being used by `Termux:Widget` by installing [`TaskerLauncherShortcut`](https://github.com/agnostic-apollo/TaskerLauncherShortcut/releases
) and open it, then options (3 dots at top right) -> `Search Shortcuts` -> `Static Shortcut` -> `Termux:Widget` -> Select any shortcut and an intent uri will be copied to clipboard, something like `com.termux.file:/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.shortcuts/tasks/test#Intent;component=com.termux.widget/.TermuxLaunchShortcutActivity;S.com.termux.shortcut.token=22e30b81-5d67-4ee3-be0e-66169f637025;end`. You can also get the token by running following in termux terminal `cat /data/data/com.termux.widget/shared_prefs/token.xml` after creating at least one launcher shortcut.

4. Create an exploit file from termux terminal: `echo 'whoami; su -c whoami; sleep 5' > /sdcard/exploit.sh`

5. Trigger the exploit from termux terminal or `adb shell`: `am start --user 0 -n com.termux.widget/.TermuxLaunchShortcutActivity -d /sdcard/exploit.sh --es com.termux.shortcut.token 22e30b81-5d67-4ee3-be0e-66169f637025`

Or use java from any app.

```java
	Intent intent = new Intent();
	intent.setClassName("com.termux.widget", "com.termux.widget.TermuxLaunchShortcutActivity");
	intent.setData(Uri.parse("/sdcard/exploit.sh"));
	intent.putExtra("com.termux.shortcut.token", "22e30b81-5d67-4ee3-be0e-66169f637025");
	startActivity(intent);
```

The termux app will run the `/sdcard/exploit.sh` script with `/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/sh` and `/sdcard` being mounted as `noexec` would not be an issue.

### 2. Fix

1. Use `ShortcutManager` APIs to create pinned shortcut on android version `>=8`. This is better way to create shortcuts since launcher does not get access to shortcut data of the app and android itself stores them, so even the launcher app would not get the token and would not be able to run any scripts whose shortcut was not explicitly created by the user. For more info on shortcut types, check https://github.com/agnostic-apollo/TaskerLauncherShortcut#shortcut-types. ([`e94d7777`](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/commit/e94d7777))

2. The token being previously used and shortcuts created on older versions of `Termux:Widget` were invalidated so that in case a malicious app already had the token, it could not use it anymore and so that users on Android `>= 8` were forced to re-create their shortcuts with safer pinned shortcuts API instead of continuing to use the old unsafer static shortcuts API. ([`32f344ee`](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/commit/32f344ee))

3. The canonical path of the executable received by `TermuxLaunchShortcutActivity` was [found](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/blob/v0.13.0/app/src/main/java/com/termux/widget/TermuxWidgetProvider.java#L183) before it was processed. Shortcuts that were broken symlinks or whose canonical path was not under the `~/.shortcuts` or `~/.termux` directory were [not shown](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/blob/v0.13.0/app/src/main/java/com/termux/widget/TermuxWidgetService.java#L30) and [execution for the later was not allowed](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/blob/v0.13.0/app/src/main/java/com/termux/widget/TermuxWidgetProvider.java#L186) even if the path was sent. ([`32f344ee`](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/commit/32f344ee), [`32f344ee`](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/commit/13954b8b), [`bcb0ab6c`](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget/commit/bcb0ab6c))

Using pinned shortcuts on android version `>=8` and not allowing execution of files whose canonical path was not under the `~/.shortcuts` or `~/.termux` directory provides reasonable security against any arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation. Users who are on Android versions `< 8` would still have to use static shortcuts and should be careful about which apps they create a shortcut in, since such apps would be able to execute any scripts under the allowed directories. Users generally should be very careful about which launcher or non-launcher shortcut apps (like [Shortcut Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rk.android.app.shortcutmaker)) they install on their device, since these apps get to execute dangerous shortcuts for apps which can have serious consequences if not protected properly by the apps.

## 3. Termux Files World Readable

This vulnerability allowed **all files** under `/data/data/com.termux/files` to be readable by **any app**.

The vulnerability existed since [`v0.47`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.47) (`2017-02-28`) till `<= v0.117` and was fixed in [`v0.118.0`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.118.0) (`2022-01-08`).

The vulnerability existed in the [termux `ContentProvider` declaration](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/v0.117/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L171) since it had set `android.permission.permRead` as [`readPermission`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/provider-element). Basically, termux [passes](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/v0.117/app/src/main/java/com/termux/app/TermuxOpenReceiver.java#L77) the [`FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` flag](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics#getting-access-with-temporary-permissions) when user requests to open a file with another app, like with `termux-open`, so the target app doesn't need to have the `android.permission.permRead` permission to be able to read the file, which also requires `grantUriPermissions="true"` in the `provider` element. However, if some app has the permission, it can **read** any files under `files` directory as [set by termux `TermuxOpenReceiver$ContentProvider.openFile()`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/v0.117/app/src/main/java/com/termux/app/TermuxOpenReceiver.java#L177).

Issue was that termux did not declare/publish the  `android.permission.permRead` permission, like it does the `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND` custom permission. Its a dummy permission, likely copied from some tutorial or stackoverflow answer when the `ContentProvider` was added, since internet searches reveal various random results from different sites for it. It was meant to be replaced with a custom permission published by the app, but it was not. That resulted in **any app** to just publish the permission in its own `AndroidManifest.xml` and grant itself the permission with `uses-permission` entry and then be able to **read** any files under `files` directory.

Note that other apps could only **read** the files, but not **write** to them since `TermuxOpenReceiver$ContentProvider.openFile()` returned the `ParcelFileDescriptor.MODE_READ_ONLY` file mode, so writing was not possible and caller would get `java.io.IOException: write failed: EBADF (Bad file descriptor)` errors if it tried to write, There was also no `writePermission` set in the `provider` element. This at least prevented arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation, which obviously would have been much worse for some cases.

### 3. Proof Of Concept

The following POC reads the `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.bashrc` and writes it to `/sdcard/bashrc.txt`.

```java
private void runTermuxContentProviderReadCommand(Context context) {
    Uri uri = Uri.parse("content://com.termux.files/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.bashrc");
    //Uri uri = Uri.parse("content://com.termux.files/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/login");
    InputStream inputStream = null;
    FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = null;

    try {
        inputStream = context.getContentResolver().openInputStream(uri);
        File outFile = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "bashrc.txt");
        fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(outFile);
        byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
        int readBytes;
        while ((readBytes = inputStream.read(buffer)) > 0) {
            Log.d(LOG_TAG, "data: " + new String(buffer, 0, readBytes, Charset.defaultCharset()));
            fileOutputStream.write(buffer, 0, readBytes);
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } finally {
        try {
            if (inputStream != null)
                inputStream.close();
            if (fileOutputStream != null)
                fileOutputStream.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

```xml
<permission
    android:name="android.permission.permRead"
    android:description="@string/permission_termux_provider_description"
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
    android:label="Termux Provider"
    android:protectionLevel="normal" />

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.permRead"  />
```

### 3. Fix

1. The dummy `android.permission.permRead` `readPermission` was *silently* replaced with `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND` in [termux `ContentProvider` declaration](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/dd952a90ade33e77b30959abf9d71c80b9702ba7/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L155). It seemed appropriate to use the same `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND` permission used for [`RUN_COMMAND` intent](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/RUN_COMMAND-Intent) and other plugin command executions for accessing files as well since commands can access files anyways, and it would be easier for third party apps to request a single permission. ([`b62645cd`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/commit/b62645cd))

2. The file mode returned by `TermuxOpenReceiver$ContentProvider.openFile()` which was previously `ParcelFileDescriptor.MODE_READ_ONLY` [was changed to](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/dd952a90ade33e77b30959abf9d71c80b9702ba7/app/src/main/java/com/termux/app/TermuxOpenReceiver.java#L196) allow both read and write or more specially any file mode defined by [`ParcelFileDescriptor.parseMode()`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/android-11.0.0_r40:frameworks/base/core/java/android/os/ParcelFileDescriptor.java;l=625). With this change, apps that don't have the `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND` permission are denied access, unless temporary read permission was granted through `termux-open`. For apps with the permission, they can use something like the following for reading and writing. Note that writing to external storage will fail with `File` APIs (`outFile.createNewFile()`) if scoped storage restrictions are being enforced for the calling app, like for `targetSdkVersion` `> 28`. ([`b62645cd`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/commit/b62645cd))

3. The termux `ContentProvider` access was only allowed if `allow-external-apps` was set to `true` in `~/.termux/termux.properties`. This also results in `termux-open` and `xdg-open` command to silently fail if value is not set to `true` in `v0.118.0`. An error notification will be added in future versions. The caller app like `QuickEdit` may still show a flash error. Check https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker#allow-external-apps-property-optional on info on how to change the value.  Write access through `ContentProvider` was also disabled for `~/.termux/termux.properties` so that apps couldn't modify termux settings without user consent, although they can still do it with `RUN_COMMAND` intent for now, at least until whitelisting commands is implemented to give users more control. ([`dcedf394`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/commit/dcedf394), [`e302a14c`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/commit/e302a14c)) 

### 3. Discussion

**All private files like security keys for `ssh` or encryption keys should be assumed to be compromised for users who were using termux app version `<= v0.117` . It is highly advisable to replace any such keys with new ones and look into any suspicious authorized access on any remote servers being connected to from termux.**

People who are still using Google Playstore version are advised to **immediately** shift to F-Droid or Github releases since updates will not be released on Google Playstore any time soon, if ever, due to [Android `10` issues](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Termux-and-Android-10). Playstore builds were [deprecated](https://github.com/termux/termux-app#google-play-store-deprecated) more than `~150` days ago and are no longer supported. Check https://github.com/termux/termux-app#installation for more info on where to install/update the Termux app.

Google Playstore, F-Droid and other stores should ideally also add checks to see if any other apps are using `android.permission.permRead` or `android.permission.permWrite` permissions or other dummy permissions found in internet searches in the app `ContentProvider` declarations and notify their devs since those apps would be vulnerable as well to such vulnerabilities. Moreover, any malicious apps declaring or requesting those permissions should also be caught and removed.

It would also be highly appreciated if any other devs review `Termux` and plugin apps code for any other potential vulnerabilities that may exist so that they can be fixed as well to provide safer environment for users.
