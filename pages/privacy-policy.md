Termux does not record any personal information and requests permissions only for termux and its plugin apps to function properly, without sending any data over the network in the background.

The [primary FossHost server](https://packages.termux.dev) which serves packages records a log of remote IP, access time and what is being accessed. This information is only stored for troubleshooting purposes and is not shared with any third parties. The [CloudFlare CDN endpoint](https://packages-cf.termux.dev) for primary host and [other termux mirrors](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Mirrors) hosted by the community and maintainers may have different policies.
