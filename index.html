     <p><strong class="first">Ready to go.</strong> 
     Termux works directly with no rooting or setup required. At first start a minimal base system
     is installed automatically - you decide what to do next.</p>

     <p><strong class="first">Secure.</strong>
     Access remote servers using the ssh client from OpenSSH. Termux combines powerful standard packages
     with accurate terminal emulation in a beautiful open source solution.</p>

     <p><strong class="first">Feature packed.</strong>
     Take your pick between bash or zsh and nano or vim. Grep through your SMS inbox.
     Access API endpoints with curl and use rsync to store backups of your contact
     list on a remote server.</p>

     <p><strong class="first">Customizable.</strong>
     Install what you want through the Apt package management system known from Debian
     and Ubuntu GNU/Linux. Why not start with installing git and syncing your dotfiles?</p>

     <p><strong class="first">Explorable.</strong>
     Have you ever sat on a bus and thought about exactly which arguments tar accepts?
     Packages available in Termux are the same as those on Mac and Linux - install man pages on your
     phone and read them in one session while experimenting with them in another.</p>

     <p><strong class="first">With batteries included.</strong> 
     Can you imagine a more powerful yet elegant pocket calculator than a readline-powered python console?
     Up-to-date versions of perl, python, ruby and node.js are all available.</p>

     <p><strong class="first">Ready to scale up.</strong> 
     Connect a bluetooth keyboard and hook up your device to an external display if you need to - Termux supports
     keyboard shortcuts and has full mouse support.<p>

     <p><strong class="first">Tinkerable.</strong> 
     Develop by compiling C files with clang or gcc and build your own projects
     with makefiles or cmake. Both gdb and strace are available if you get stuck and need to debug.</p>
